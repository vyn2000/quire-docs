    note: "Materia used Quire to create its inaugural journal issue. The Materia team customized the issue by changing fonts, banner sizes, and colors and by adding in an icon (a microscope) to denote if articles had been peer-reviewed. Materia chose Quire as it offered the ability to deliver free technical art history content to the world and provided a means of achieving ISSN/library status."

    note: "While their 2020 cohort of scholars didn’t have an in-person conference to attend, the Museum Computer Network (MCN) instead offered them the opportunity to contribute to a unique publication that would focus on the current state of museum technology and sustainability. With ten essays in hand, Quire offered MCN a free and relatively easy way of creating the book and getting it online. MCN also made the title available on Amazon in print and e-book through the Kindle Direct Publishing service (https://kdp.amazon.com). A grant from Kress supported the scholars, editing, and the modest cost of printing and shipping author copies of the book, as well as copies to recent MCN Board members and supporters."

    note: "Mia wished to publish a digital catalogue raisonne that 1) met the requirements of academic publishing (ie: stable, findable, citable) 2) provided a book-like structure and user experience (ie: bounded content, mostly linear structure, and straightforward navigability), and 3) could act as the digital front end for an archive whose data is housed in Mia's digital asset management systems. Quire supports all but the last of these. To create the catalogue section, Mia's developers mapped collections data from Mia's DAMS into Quire's objects.yml file based on the object IDs of artworks referenced in the publication. While the data pull is automated, the connection is not “live;” a fresh data pull will coincide with the publication of subsequent editions of the catalogue, to be noted in the back matter."
